                    <p class="dhaka-p col-sm-12">Chittagong Division, officially known as Chattogram Division, is
                        geographically the largest of the eight administrative divisions of Bangladesh. It covers the
                        south-easternmost areas of the country, with a total area of 33,909.00 km2 (13,092.34 sq mi)
                        and a population at the 2011 census of 28,423,019.^[6] The administrative division includes
                        mainland Chittagong District, neighbouring districts and the Chittagong Hill Tracts.

                        Chittagong Division is home to Cox's Bazar, the longest natural sea beach in the world;as
                        well as St. Martin's Island, Bangladesh's sole coral reef.The Chittagong Division was
                        established in 1829 to serve as an administrative headquarters for five of Bengal's easternmost
                        districts, with the Chittagong District serving as its headquarters.During the East Pakistan
                        period, the division's Tippera district was renamed to Comilla District in 1960.

                        In 1984, fifteen districts were created by separating and reducing the original five districts
                        of Chittagong, Comilla, Hill Tracts, Noakhali and Sylhet:

                        The Chittagong District was divided into two districts; Chittagong and Cox's Bazar District
                        The Comilla District was split into three districts; Comilla, Brahmanbaria and Chandpur
                        The Hill Tracts District was split into three districts; Bandarban, Khagrachhari and Rangamati
                        The Noakhali District was divided into three districts; Noakhali, Lakshmipur and Feni
                        The Sylhet District was split into four districts; Sylhet, Habiganj, Moulvibazar and Sunamganj.
                        Sylhet, Habiganj, Moulvibazar and Sunamganj district ceded from the Chittagong Division to join
                        a newly-established Sylhet Division in 1995. <br><br>
                        Chittagong Division is presently subdivided into eleven districts (zilas) and thence into 99
                        sub-districts (upazilas). The first six districts listed below comprise the north-western
                        portion (37.6%) of the division, while the remaining five comprise the south-eastern portion
                        (62.4%), the two portions being separated by the lower (or Bangladeshi) stretch of the Feni
                        River; the upland districts of Khagrachhari, Rangamati and Bandarban together comprise that area
                        previously known as the Chittagong Hill Tracts.
