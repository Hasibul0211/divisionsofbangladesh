                    <p class="dhaka-p col-sm-12">Dhaka Division (Bengali: ঢাকা বিভাগ, Ḑhaka Bibhag) is an administrative
                        division
                        within
                        Bangladesh.Dhaka is the capital city of Bangladesh and also the largest city as well of the
                        country. It comes among the 10 most populous cities of the world. The Division as constituted
                        prior to 2015 covered an area of 31,051 km2,and had a population of 47,424,418 at the 2011
                        Census. However, following the separation of the new Mymensingh Division in 2015, the area has
                        been reduced to 20,508.8 km2 with a population at the 2011 Census of 36,433,505.

                        Dhaka Division borders every other division in the country except Rangpur Division. It is
                        bounded by Mymensingh Division to the north, Barisal Division to the south, Chittagong Division
                        to the east and south-east, Sylhet Division to the north-east, and Rajshahi Division to the west
                        and Khulna Divisions to the south-west. <br><br>
                        Dhaka Division consisted before 2015 of four city corporations, 17 districts, 123 upazilas and
                        1,248 union parishads. However, four of the most northerly of the 17 districts were removed in
                        2015 to create the new Mymensingh Division, and another five districts (those situated to the
                        south of the Ganges/Padma River) are in the process of being removed to create a new Faridpur
                        Division.
