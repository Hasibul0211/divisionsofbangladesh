                    <p class="dhaka-p col-sm-12">Rajshahi Division (Bengali: রাজশাহী বিভাগ) is one of the eight
                        first-level administrative divisions of Bangladesh. It has an area of 18,174.4 square kilometres
                        (7,017.2 sq mi) and a population at the 2011 Census of 18,484,858.Rajshahi Division
                        consists of 8 districts, 70 Upazilas (the next lower administrative tier) and 1,092 Unions (the
                        lowest administrative tier). The divisional capital of Rajshahi is only six-seven hours road
                        journey away from Dhaka, the capital city. Rajshahi Division is located in western Bangladesh.
                        It is bounded by the Padma River to its south and Jamuna River, to its east. It shares a border
                        with the Indian state of West Bengal to its west and the Rangpur Division to its north. <br><br>
                        The region has historically been dominated by various feudal Rajas, Maharajas and Zamindars.
                        Formerly comprising 16 districts, a new division (Rangpur Division) was formed with the 8
                        northern districts of the old Rajshahi Division from early 2010.The Rajshahi Division is named
                        after the Rajshahi District. Dominated by various feudal Rajas, Maharajas and Zamindars of mixed
                        origins throughout history,the name is a compound of the words Raj and Shahi, both of which can
                        be translated into reign or kingdom. Archaic spellings in the English language also included
                        Rajeshae. The capital city of the division was formerly known as Rampur Boalia but was later
                        renamed to Rajshahi too, to match the name of the district.
                        Rajshahi is well known for its fruit, particularly for mango and lichi. Rajshahi also produces a
                        lot of crops and vegetables like potato, carrot, rice, onion, wheat, sugarcane, pulses, spices,
                        banana etc. Naogaon is known as the storehouse of food of Bangladesh.
