                        Bangladeshi divisions of Chittagong to the southwest and Dhaka and Mymensingh to the west.The
                        name Sylhet is an anglicisation of Shilhot (শিলহট). Its origins seem to come from the Sanskrit
                        words শিলা śilā (meaning 'stone') and হট্ট haṭṭa (meaning 'marketplace'). These words match the
                        landscape and topography of the hilly region. The shila stones were abundant across Sylhet and
                        King Gour Govinda is known to have used stones to guard his capital. The word changed to Shilhot
