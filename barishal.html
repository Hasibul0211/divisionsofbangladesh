                    <p class="dhaka-p col-sm-12">Barishal Division is one of the eight administrative divisions of
                        Bangladesh. Located in the south-central part of the country, it has an area of 13,644.85 km2
                        (5,268.31 sq mi), and a population of 8,325,666 at the 2011 Census. It is bounded by Dhaka
                        Division on the north, the Bay of Bengal on the south, Chittagong Division on the east and
                        Khulna Division on the west. The administrative capital, Barisal city, lies in the Padma River
                        delta on an offshoot of the Arial Khan River. Barisal division is criss-crossed by numerous
                        rivers that earned it the nickname 'Dhan-Nodi-Khal, Ei tine Borishal' (rice, river and canal
                        built Barisal).
                        <br><br>
                        In early times the Barisal region was composed of an amalgamation of marshlands formed by the
                        merging of islands brought into existence and built up by alluvial soils washed down the great
                        channels of the combined Brahmaputra-Ganges-Meghna river systems.

                        In the early 13th century, Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji led the Muslim conquest of Barisal, and
                        soon later Muhammad bin Tughluq completely conquered eastern Bengal. The Hindu chieftains from
                        northwest Bengal were dislodged from power and they dispersed over Barisal region and founded
                        the kingdom of Bakla.

                        During the Mughal intervention in Bengal, Hindu society was concentrated to northern and western
                        Barisal (known as Bakarganj). Barisal's southern portion was still covered by forests and laced
                        with lagoons. The northwest was also the only part of Bakarganj where the Hindu population
                        exceeded Muslims in early British censuses.
                        <br>In 1797 the area was established as Bakerganj District but later renamed as Barisal District
                        and Pir of Hizla-Muladi, Faizus Ahmed Khan stayed back & settled in Muladi-Hizla village. <br>In
                        1947 the area was continued as a Bakerganj District, as one of four districts of Khulna Division
                        but later renamed as Barisal District.
                        <br>Barisal is known as the "Granary of Bengal" for its rice production. It is still an
                        important rice-producing area of the country. Since the Middle Ages, Barisal has acted as a
                        trans-shipment center for hides, rice, dried beans, dried peas, lentils, chickpeas, and other
                        legumes for Bengal. Bakery, textile, and pharmaceutical products are the output of a few
                        industrial installations. There are Sher-e Bangla Medical College (affiliated with the National
                        University) and B. M. College (an educational institution of Barisal Division established in
                        1889). Barisal is also a river port once connecting Calcutta-Barisal-Dhaka and many other
                        routes. Today Barisal River port is the most important hub of steamer and motor launch service
                        of the Southern Bangladesh.
