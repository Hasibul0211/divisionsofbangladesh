                    <p class="dhaka-p col-sm-12">Mymensingh Division (Bengali: ময়মনসিংহ বিভাগ) is one of the eight
                        administrative divisions of Bangladesh. It has an area of 10,485 square kilometres (4,048 sq mi)
                        and a population of 11,370,000 as of the 2011 census. It was created in 2015 from districts
                        previously composing the northern part of Dhaka Division. Its headquarters are in Mymensingh
                        city in Mymensingh District. <br><br>
                        The Greater Mymensingh region (Mymensingh District along with five other neighbouring districts)
                        was created as a Mymensingh district by the British Indian government in 1787. Later it was
                        reorganized in two phases into six districts: Mymensingh, Kishoreganj, Netrakona, Jamalpur,
                        Tangail, and Sherpur.[3] But Kishoreganj and Tangail are no longer part of Mymensingh, so
                        Mymensingh comprises four districts.

                        On 12 January 2015 prime minister Sheikh Hasina declared the establishment of a new Mymensingh
                        Division. The initial intention was to carve six districts (those comprising the original
                        Mymensingh district of 1787) out of the Dhaka Division. However, while four of the districts
                        were eager for the establishment of a new division, people in the Tangail and Kishoreganj
                        Districts wished to remain part of Dhaka Division.[4][5] On 14 September 2015 Mymensingh was
                        officially announced as a division consisting four districts.Census figures for 1991, 2001 and
                        2011 are from Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, Population Census Wing. The 2011 Census figures
                        are based on preliminary results.
